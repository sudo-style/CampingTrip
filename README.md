## Camping Trip Game

# Gameplay Instructions:
Read the narrative, and follow the links to follow your dreams of becoming the next big adventurer.

# How the game works:
I start by getting setting everything to false, and over time, as the user picks the roles that they want or objects they want to use, they will develop skills in different areas. I have also eliminated options so that the user doesn't get stuck in a loop. Eventually, when they either die or win, everything will reset if they want to play again.

# How it is played:
You try to survive the night. Making choices that might end up killing you, or giving you an advantage for the game.

# What technology choices you made: 
I wanted there to be different paths depending on the choices made at the start. I was going to have 3 different classes, one being a Luxury Camper, one being a McGuyver type, and another being a Bear Grills type. But instead, I just limited it to 2, which will change some of the options down the line.

# Any installation and gameplay instructions:
Just need to double-click on the HTML file, and you should be good to go. 

# Lessons learned:
Some of the lessons that I have learned are that twine while simple to use, offers a lot of mechanics to turn an ordinary try game into something more powerful. For example, there are ways that I have been playing around with today to change the colors of text, use variables to store information, create other paths depending on choices that the user has made, and ways to change the text of links. One weird thing that I noticed was that the game engine doesn't use curly braces which was weird, instead only using square brackets. I typically don't play these types of games, but it was fun to see sorta how they work, and what makes them fun to play.

There were a lot of features that I still want to add to the game but didn't have the time to do. I think that I need to work more on my time management, as I have been busy with a Neural Network that I have been working on, and another class summer class.
